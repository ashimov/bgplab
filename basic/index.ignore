# Getting Started

In the first set of the lab exercises you'll do basic BGP-related configuration tasks:

* [Establish a BGP session](1-session.md)
* [Connect to two upstream providers](2-multihomed.md)
* Advertise your IP prefixes

You can also challenge yourself with more advanced tasks:

* Protect a BGP session with MD5 password, TCP-AO password, and TTL check
* Run EBGP over unnumbered IPv4 interfaces or over IPv6 link-local addresses
